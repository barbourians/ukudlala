Now see if you can write a program in Python that takes two words from the keyboard
and outputs one after the other on the same line. E.g., if you keyed in ‘Humpty’ and
‘Dumpty’ it would reply with ‘Humpty Dumpty’ (note the space in between). A run of
the program should look like this:
Please key in a word: Humpty
And now key in another: Dumpty
You have typed: Humpty Dumpty
